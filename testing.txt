Testing for supplemental problem 4: a Daily Calendar

The most obvious issue that could arise with this program is a failure
to correctly allocate a new array if the old appointmen array is full.
To test this we will begin with a small case, setting the max size
of the array to 4 appointments. This is accomplised by setting the 
variable   int maxSize = 4; in the third line of the main procedure. We
will now compile and run the program--this can be achieved by simply typing
"make" and then running the program with ./1. Now we add 4 appointments, 
so the old array must be full. We see that the program continues to run
and the prompt
"Previous appointment book full, more space now allocated"
is printed after the calendar menu and adding more appointments proceeds
as expected.
